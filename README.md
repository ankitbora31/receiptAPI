# Introduction
- Reciept API 
- Simple API for storing and accessing the receipt details for any user.


##  :beginner: About
API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.

## :zap: Usage
One of the top reasons developers use APIs is to integrate one system with another system.
Adding or enhancing functionality for customers
APIs can help improve software and system testing by allowing quality engineering teams to separate tests for frontend components, the parts of software that users see, from tests for backend components, the parts of software that users donâ€™t see.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- Steps on how to install this project, to use it.
- This project was done on Springboot (It is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework)
- Starting with the installation (step by step, nothing complex)
- Using Spring Initializer generating the structure of the project. Like name of the project, adding dependencies and setting the version.
- Installing MySQL as we are working with the mySql to store and fetch our data.
- Adding a properties file where we set the connection status to the mySql.
- Installing Postman is must as we need to test our API


### :notebook: Pre-Requisites
- Java Core
- MySQL
- SpringBoot
- Postman

###  :nut_and_bolt: Development Environment
- Dependencies can be set while starting the project in spring initializer phase although if you miss any of the dependency, these can be further added in pom file which stores all the dependencies. When we initialize the spring it already provides us a pom file.
- This project is done using maven so the structure is to be followed while adding dependencies as 
<dependency>
 <groupId></groupId>
 <artifactId></artifactId>
</dependency>

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
